# unsupervised_learning - Myopia Clusters

In this project, data is being placed into groups using and using clustering algorithms. Findings are plotted so they can be visualised. 

## Background

A medical research company that’s interested in finding better ways to predict myopia, or nearsightedness has tried—and failed—to improve their classification model when training on the whole dataset. However, they believe that there might be distinct groups of patients that would be better to analyze separately. So, the task is to explore this possibility by using unsupervised learning.

Raw data has been provided, so this first needs to be processed to fit the machine learning models. 
Several clustering algorithms will be used to explore whether the patients can be placed into distinct groups. Then, a visualization is created to share the findings.

## Key tasks of this project

* Part 1: Prepare the Data

* Part 2: Apply Dimensionality Reduction 

* Part 3: Perform a Cluster Analysis with K-means

* Part 4: Make a Recommendation
